# Final Part One: Planning, Sketching, Researching

## Summary of Project:
For my Telling Stories with Data final project, I would like to make a case for why arts organizations should make more comprehensive digital experiences for audience engagement. One of the bases of this argument will be accessibility and the increased access that digital experiences offer, which is mission-fulfilling and serves a real purpose for the community. Secondly, I will demonstrate how the trend of digital engagement has increased in recent years, and as the public becomes more accustomed to experiencing the arts online, there will be a higher demand for digital content. 

## Story Structure: Outline

* INTRODUCTION
  * Digital landscapes have fundamentally changed. Why haven’t the arts caught up?
  * A narrative of someone accessing arts and culture who otherwise may not have
* EVIDENCE AND CASE: Why digital content can boost mission
  *  Currently, most arts organizations do not focus efforts on online content, rather they might but up a digital collection or some videos about their collections, but rarely anything live and engaging.
  * Quantitative DATA: From Culture Track’s Top Line Report: Digital engagement survey responses. (Shows the GENERAL AUDIENCE VALUE In digital experiences)
* ACCESSIBILITY
  * Quantitative DATA: 2012 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts shows the difference between rates of attendance of able-bodied and disabled participants.
  * Qualitative DATA: From “Creating an Accessible Digital Experience: Moving from Compliance to Sustainable Accessibility and Usability”
* HOW IT CAN BE DONE
  * Show BEST PRACTICE (Via visualizations made from looking at Wayback machine) a timeline of movement into the digital realm of a singular arts org (who is doing it well) – their journey to offering more digital content. 
  * FINAL CASE: Tie the Household Pulse Survey (pull Changes in digital habits over past 5 years) into arts organizations: We can make some assumptions about digital arts engagement knowing about digital shopping engagement.
* CONCLUSION AND CALL TO ACTION
  * Re-iterate how this can serve your mission, heighten accessibility, and reach a wider audience.
  * (Considering the “users” of this message would be arts managers): Link to consulting firms, best practices articles and other tools they can use if they want to start ramping up their digital content. 


## Initial Sketches
Here are my initial sketches, imaginging a continuous scroll on a Shorthand page.

## Data
My primary data sources will be: 
1. Culture Track’s 2017 Top Line Report about Audience Engagement and the Arts
   Raw data excel sheet available for download: https://culturetrack.com/research/reports/
This report is about a paradigm shift in 2017 in Arts Participation. It outlines who is going where, demographics, user preferences, economic value, and many other aspects of audience engagement with the arts. I will primarily be using this study for its findings on “the Digital Dilemma” as it demonstrates what audiences in 2017 valued in digital arts experiences, who want them the most, and at what types of arts orgs they are most preferred.

2. 2012 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts from the NEA. Rraw data is available in SPSS, SAS, and STATA form here: https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/publications/decade-arts-engagement-findings-survey-public-participation-arts-2002-2012 along with a data user guide.
 This is a very extensive NEA Survey Report that gives a holistic view of who, when, and where there is audience participation in the arts and culture sector and shows a decade of changes 2002-2012. I will be using this data to show the differences in demographics and access to museums: How differently-abled people participate differently, as well as what public perceptions of museums are (as a case for why digital access may appeal more to some visitors.) 

3. The Household Pulse Survey run by the U.S. Census Bureau. Raw data tables (excel) available here: https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html
 The Household Pulse Survey has been employed since March 2020. It is measuring household activity during the Covid-19 Pandemic. This is a very comprehensive survey that includes many aspects of family life, but I will be pulling out two of their sections for my own report: At-home internet usage and access (increase since march 2020) as well as At home children’s educational activities (Hours have increased). Both of these statistics will show how more people are using the internet, as well as searching for participatory education opportunities for their children.

4. Wayback Machine: Visual Timeline of a Singular Arts Organizaitons’ journey to enriching digital content
 This is data that I will be collecting myself via the Wayback machine. I don’t have an organization picked out yet as I am still benchmarking different ones to try and find one that is a really good example of best practice. But I will use the Wayback machine and document certain points in time where they added more or changed their digital offerings just to show a practical example of how this can be done. Additionally, if I can find information on public participation over time for these activities, I will include that.


## Method and Medium
I plan on producing this storyline on Shorthand, as a singular scroll with the main sections I described in my Outline. For my visualizations, I will be using Shorthand and creating bar graphs and line graphs. I will also make smaller, non-comparative data visualizations (infographics) via Canva. 
Additionally, I plan to use Canva to make my timeline of an arts organization’s digital journey, as it is not straightforward data-wise and Flourish probably wouldn’t work for it.

I would also like to give some engaging and interesting examples of how a variety of institutions have approached digital audience engagement. To do that, I would like to make a photo album/flipbook on Shorthand (or on Sway and embed it on Shorthand) that users can flip through at their leisure to see examples.

For my one-minute presentation, I am planning on showing my Shorthand briefly but mainly giving the high-level overview and main compelling visualizations on the Shorthand. After I have it all built out and practice my presentation, I may decide to highlight only one visualization for my presentation.

## Notes from Critique on 9/27
Critique participants mentioned that the value proposition for more digital content may need to be strengthened. I plan on highlighting more clearly how it is mission serving to reach more audiences via digital offerings, and also to bring in some of the educational data I have from the household pulse survey. Showing that families are increasingly looking towards online methods for at home educational experiences for children can be part of the value proposition in why education departments of arts organizations can/should offer online learning opportunities.
What they liked:
They mentioned that they liked the titles I used for separate sections, and that the flow made sense overall. 


# Final Part Two
For this iteration of my final, I took my sketches and started building them out on Canva and Flourish using the data I found.
Something I came across was that once I was actually putting the (draft) visualizations into Shorthand I was able to see gaps in my argument more clearly. I ended finding a few new sources that would help my argument and made some visualizations based off of those.
I also took into account the initial feedback I got on my sketch was, and tried to use some more data to really show the connections and value of my argument.
I chose a color pallette, then built out my wireframes and storyboard in Shorthand.

## User Research on storyboards
The target audience that I would hope to reach with my research is fellow arts administrators. For that reason, I selected a few fellow arts management students to review my work. Additionally, because I would like this work to be accessible/understandable to anyone, I also asked some non-arts management people to review (two individuals in the PPM program from class, and my roommate.)

I asked a few arts management students to review my work under the following criteria:
- Did the visualizations add to or take away the central argument?
- Did anything confuse you?
- Do you think the story supports the call to action?
- What would you do differently?

I received a lot of helpful feedback, positive and negative, that will inform my work as I move into the final stages of the project. 
- Visualizations--Everyone said that the visualizations add to the argument.
- Confusion--Some of the consistent feedback I got was that the visualizations become a bit overwhelming. I orginially had a continuous scroll of one visualization after the other, but I changed that based on feedback so that multiple data points would be included in a single visual (The increase in digital engagement.)
- Call to action: I also received feedback that the call to action could be stronger, and that I might include a data visualization in the call to action.
- What people would do differently: Most of this feedback was surrounding visuals and formatting. Interviewees mentioned that I should directly embed my visualizations from Canva so the formatting isn't so awkward, and use more of the interactive/moving features in Shorthand.

Some key quotes from my user research:
- "I like how you keep the same color scheme and use a few different kinds of visualizations"
- "The call to action could be stronger, and include practical resources" (I added in a section that I plan on working on regarding resources.)
- "Could you make the images on the line graph more clear?"



# Final Part Three

## It's Time to Work Towards Digital Futures for Museums
This project has been researched, added to, researched, and re-iterated over the course of the past few weeks.
The final products showcases a few main justifications for my central claim (see title). These sections include:
 * How much of museum collections are publicly viewable
 * Who is looking for online museum content and why
 * Online content can increase accessibility for visitors with disabilities
 * Online content addresses large barriers to museum attendance
 * Covid-19 changed how we interact with digital spaces
The story finishes with a few examples of online offerings and a  call to action that includes resources for arts managers, the primary audeince for this research.

## Research
I used a wide variety of studies for the data showcased in this project--including work by Pew Research Center, National Endowment for the Arts, and Culture Track. I wanted to make cohesive data imagery that tells a story. 
Much of the data I found was in written form, and iterating how to demonstrate that in the most effective way visually was one of the more challenging aspects of this project. 
I used 19 different sources while researching this project. 

## Pesona/User
The final persona/user of my project is museum managers. Orginially I was thinking this would be relevant to all arts managers (which it may be), but as I went through my research I wanted to narrow it down specifically to museum managers in order to provide them data and resources that are really relevant to their work specifically. 


## Last Iterations: Final Project Changes
The changes I made from part two to Part three of this project were mostly surrounding a few aesthetic changes, and incorporating the written narrative into the flow of the data story.
In the final iteration, I decided not to use some of the internet usage data I orginally intended on using from the Household Pulse Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, mainly because I already had so much information on digital engagement that was more geared towards my argument. The Pew Research report ended up being more favorable data for this section.

I also segmented out the different sections and tried to make them more clear, as each section is a separate justification for my argument of why museums should enhance their online offerings.

While I was going through the written narrative, I realized that I wanted to make my data visualizations the center of the project, and I ended up writing significantly less than I thought I would. I felt like I was re-iterating what was clear from the visualizations, so I just decided to keep the writing aspect slim and let the data speak for itself. From a user perspective, I wanted managers to see the data presented and decide for themselves how relevant it is to their institutions.

I also realized through getting some feedback from friends that the beginning of the story could have more of a punch to draw readers in.
For that reason, I decided to incoporporate a visualization that shows how little of museums collections are accessible to the public. I used Flourish to create this visualization.
<img width="1424" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-09 at 12 30 25 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112904052/194768482-f6760886-b392-4fa5-86e4-3703077adce5.png">

Additionally, I added a stronger call to action that included resources for my intended audience--this was a result of my user research on my Part Two storyboard. I tried to consider what the users of this (museum managers) would like to see, so I linked articles and resources at the bottom that would be useful should they want to pursue implementing digital collections or experiences at their museum.
<img width="1195" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-09 at 12 37 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112904052/194768768-b87c460a-7ad3-43f3-98d9-5ec2f6cdd2bf.png">

Another big change I made was screen recording some digital activities on museum websites and posting them in a media gallery section of the Shorthand page. I thought it could be useful for users to see some of what is out there and start benchmarking or considering what they would like those experiences be like for their own organizations.

Finally I added pictures to the Louvre timeline to give more of a visual reference point for their journey over recent years.

Other than these main changes, I just cleaned up the shorthand and made it flow from section to section a bit better. 

## Key Takeaways from this Process
Some of the major things I learned throughout this process were:
* Feedback is crucial for data visualizations, because you (as someone who knows the data you are showing) might think a chart or graph is perfectly clear, but someone who is new to the idea or data may be very confused by what point it is trying to make or even what data it is displaying.
* Consistent formatting, color, and text actually makes the argument make more sense: It doesn't just look nicer. 
    - I realized this through the first few iterations of this project--the people I was getting feedback from genuinely seemed to understand the information conveyed more clearly when there was a consistent style throughout the project. It seems like when the brain has to do less of the work in terms of making those connections, it can focus more clearly on the information itself.

## Presentation
Because there are so many different data points in this project, and I only have one minute to present, I think my presentation will focus largely on the first graphic/point: That museums are only showing a very minimal percent of the works that they have on view. Especially because this presentation will be to a room of people who are not museum managers, I think that data point is one that everyone can see as compelling: no one likes to think about thousands of priceless works just sitting in storage, not being used for any public benefit. I will highlight briefly the other justifications that are included in the Shorthand, but want to keep my presentation as clear, simple, concise, and compelling as possible.
