# Final Part Three

## It's Time to Work Towards Digital Futures for Museums
This project has been researched, added to, researched, and re-iterated over the course of the past few weeks.
The final products showcases a few main justifications for my central claim (see title). These sections include:
 * How much of museum collections are publicly viewable
 * Who is looking for online museum content and why
 * Online content can increase accessibility for visitors with disabilities
 * Online content addresses large barriers to museum attendance
 * Covid-19 changed how we interact with digital spaces
The story finishes with a few examples of online offerings and a  call to action that includes resources for arts managers, the primary audeince for this research.

## Research
I used a wide variety of studies for the data showcased in this project--including work by Pew Research Center, National Endowment for the Arts, and Culture Track. I wanted to make cohesive data imagery that tells a story. 
Much of the data I found was in written form, and iterating how to demonstrate that in the most effective way visually was one of the more challenging aspects of this project. 
I used 19 different sources while researching this project. 

## Pesona/User
The final persona/user of my project is museum managers. Orginially I was thinking this would be relevant to all arts managers (which it may be), but as I went through my research I wanted to narrow it down specifically to museum managers in order to provide them data and resources that are really relevant to their work specifically. 


## Last Iterations: Final Project
The changes I made from part two to Part three of this project were mostly surrounding a few aesthetic changes, and incorporating the written narrative into the flow of the data story.
I segmented out the different sections and tried to make them more clear, as each section is a separate justification for my argument of why museums should enhance their online offerings.

While I was going through the written narrative, I realized that I wanted to make my data visualizations the center of the project, and I ended up writing significantly less than I thought I would. I felt like I was re-iterating what was clear from the visualizations, so I just decided to keep the writing aspect slim and let the data speak for itself. From a user perspective, I wanted managers to see the data presented and decide for themselves how relevant it is to their institutions.

I also realized through getting some feedback from friends that the beginning of the story could have more of a punch to draw readers in.
For that reason, I decided to incoporporate a visualization that shows how little of museums collections are accessible to the public. I used Flourish to create this visualization.

Additionally, I added a stronger call to action that included resources for my intended audience--this was a result of my user research on my Part Two storyboard. I tried to consider what the users of this (museum managers) would like to see, so I linked articles and resources at the bottom that would be useful should they want to pursue implementing digital collections or experiences at their museum.

Another big change I made was screen recording some digital activities on museum websites and posting them in a media gallery section of the Shorthand page. I thought it could be useful for users to see some of what is out there and start benchmarking or considering what they would like those experiences be like for their own organizations.

Finally I added pictures to the Louvre timeline to give more of a visual reference point for their journey over recent years.

Other than these main changes, I just cleaned up the shorthand and made it flow from section to section a bit better. 

## Key Takeaways from this Process
Some of the major things I learned throughout this process were:
* Feedback is crucial for data visualizations, because you (as someone who knows the data you are showing) might think a chart or graph is perfectly clear, but someone who is new to the idea or data may be very confused by what point it is trying to make or even what data it is displaying.
* Consistent formatting, color, and text actually makes the argument make more sense: It doesn't just look nicer. 
    - I realized this through the first few iterations of this project--the people I was getting feedback from genuinely seemed to understand the information conveyed more clearly when there was a consistent style throughout the project. It seems like when the brain has to do less of the work in terms of making those connections, it can focus more clearly on the information itself.

## Presentation
Because there are so many different data points in this project, and I only have one minute to present, I think my presentation will focus largely on the first graphic/point: That museums are only showing a very minimal percent of the works that they have on view. Especially because this presentation will be to a room of people who are not museum managers, I think that data point is one that everyone can see as compelling: no one likes to think about thousands of priceless works just sitting in storage, not being used for any public benefit. I will highlight briefly the other justifications that are included in the Shorthand, but want to keep my presentation as clear, simple, concise, and compelling as possible.
