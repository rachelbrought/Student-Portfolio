## Last Iterations: Final Project
The changes I made from part two to Part three of this project were mostly surrounding a few aesthetic changes, and incorporating the written narrative into the flow of the data story.
I segmented out the different sections and tried to make them more clear, as each section is a separate justification for my argument of why museums should enhance their online offerings.
I also realized through getting some feedback from friends that the beginning of the story could have more of a punch to draw readers in.
For that reason, I decided to incoporporate a visualization that shows how little of museums collections are accessible to the public. I used Flourish to create this visualization.
