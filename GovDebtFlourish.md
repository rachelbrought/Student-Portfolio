## Assignment 1: Visualizing Government Debt
Using the OECD Dataset, I downloaded this bar chart showing Debt-to-GDP ratios:
<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Ofz" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2021</iframe>

Next, I translated that dataset to visualize it in a few new ways vis Flourish:
## Flourish Exercise #1
Here is the First visualization of government debt using Flourish. This grid of charts allows you to compare by country, the Debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995-2019.
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11153296"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


## Flourish Exercise #2
This second visualization created on Flourish allows you to toggle by country. This chart could be easier than the grid if someone wanted to focus on just a few countries in particular, and easily see the differences by toggling back and forth.
