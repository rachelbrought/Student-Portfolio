# Final Part One: Planning, Sketching, Researching

## Summary of Project:
For my Telling Stories with Data final project, I would like to make a case for why arts organizations should make more comprehensive digital experiences for audience engagement. One of the bases of this argument will be accessibility and the increased access that digital experiences offer, which is mission-fulfilling and serves a real purpose for the community. Secondly, I will demonstrate how the trend of digital engagement has increased in recent years, and as the public becomes more accustomed to experiencing the arts online, there will be a higher demand for digital content. 

## Story Structure: Outline

* INTRODUCTION
  * Digital landscapes have fundamentally changed. Why haven’t the arts caught up?
  * A narrative of someone accessing arts and culture who otherwise may not have
* EVIDENCE AND CASE: Why digital content can boost mission
  *  Currently, most arts organizations do not focus efforts on online content, rather they might but up a digital collection or some videos about their collections, but rarely anything live and engaging.
  * Quantitative DATA: From Culture Track’s Top Line Report: Digital engagement survey responses. (Shows the GENERAL AUDIENCE VALUE In digital experiences)
* ACCESSIBILITY
  * Quantitative DATA: 2012 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts shows the difference between rates of attendance of able-bodied and disabled participants.
  * Qualitative DATA: From “Creating an Accessible Digital Experience: Moving from Compliance to Sustainable Accessibility and Usability”
* HOW IT CAN BE DONE
  * Show BEST PRACTICE (Via visualizations made from looking at Wayback machine) a timeline of movement into the digital realm of a singular arts org (who is doing it well) – their journey to offering more digital content. 
  * FINAL CASE: Tie the Household Pulse Survey (pull Changes in digital habits over past 5 years) into arts organizations: We can make some assumptions about digital arts engagement knowing about digital shopping engagement.
* CONCLUSION AND CALL TO ACTION
  * Re-iterate how this can serve your mission, heighten accessibility, and reach a wider audience.
  * (Considering the “users” of this message would be arts managers): Link to consulting firms, best practices articles and other tools they can use if they want to start ramping up their digital content. 


## Initial Sketches
Here are my initial sketches, imaginging a continuous scroll on a Shorthand page.

## Data
My primary data sources will be: 
1. Culture Track’s 2017 Top Line Report about Audience Engagement and the Arts
   Raw data excel sheet available for download: https://culturetrack.com/research/reports/
This report is about a paradigm shift in 2017 in Arts Participation. It outlines who is going where, demographics, user preferences, economic value, and many other aspects of audience engagement with the arts. I will primarily be using this study for its findings on “the Digital Dilemma” as it demonstrates what audiences in 2017 valued in digital arts experiences, who want them the most, and at what types of arts orgs they are most preferred.

2. 2012 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts from the NEA. Rraw data is available in SPSS, SAS, and STATA form here: https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/publications/decade-arts-engagement-findings-survey-public-participation-arts-2002-2012 along with a data user guide.
 This is a very extensive NEA Survey Report that gives a holistic view of who, when, and where there is audience participation in the arts and culture sector and shows a decade of changes 2002-2012. I will be using this data to show the differences in demographics and access to museums: How differently-abled people participate differently, as well as what public perceptions of museums are (as a case for why digital access may appeal more to some visitors.) 

3. The Household Pulse Survey run by the U.S. Census Bureau. Raw data tables (excel) available here: https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html
 The Household Pulse Survey has been employed since March 2020. It is measuring household activity during the Covid-19 Pandemic. This is a very comprehensive survey that includes many aspects of family life, but I will be pulling out two of their sections for my own report: At-home internet usage and access (increase since march 2020) as well as At home children’s educational activities (Hours have increased). Both of these statistics will show how more people are using the internet, as well as searching for participatory education opportunities for their children.

4. Wayback Machine: Visual Timeline of a Singular Arts Organizaitons’ journey to enriching digital content
 This is data that I will be collecting myself via the Wayback machine. I don’t have an organization picked out yet as I am still benchmarking different ones to try and find one that is a really good example of best practice. But I will use the Wayback machine and document certain points in time where they added more or changed their digital offerings just to show a practical example of how this can be done. Additionally, if I can find information on public participation over time for these activities, I will include that.


## Method and Medium
I plan on producing this storyline on Shorthand, as a singular scroll with the main sections I described in my Outline. For my visualizations, I will be using Shorthand and creating bar graphs and line graphs. I will also make smaller, non-comparative data visualizations (infographics) via Canva. 
Additionally, I plan to use Canva to make my timeline of an arts organization’s digital journey, as it is not straightforward data-wise and Flourish probably wouldn’t work for it.

I would also like to give some engaging and interesting examples of how a variety of institutions have approached digital audience engagement. To do that, I would like to make a photo album/flipbook on Shorthand (or on Sway and embed it on Shorthand) that users can flip through at their leisure to see examples.

For my one-minute presentation, I am planning on showing my Shorthand briefly but mainly giving the high-level overview and main compelling visualizations on the Shorthand. After I have it all built out and practice my presentation, I may decide to highlight only one visualization for my presentation.

## Notes from Critique on 9/27
Critique participants mentioned that the value proposition for more digital content may need to be strengthened. I plan on highlighting more clearly how it is mission serving to reach more audiences via digital offerings, and also to bring in some of the educational data I have from the household pulse survey. Showing that families are increasingly looking towards online methods for at home educational experiences for children can be part of the value proposition in why education departments of arts organizations can/should offer online learning opportunities.
What they liked:
They mentioned that they liked the titles I used for separate sections, and that the flow made sense overall.
