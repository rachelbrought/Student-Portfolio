# Final Part One: Planning, Sketching, Researching

## Summary of Project:
For my Telling Stories with Data final project, I would like to make a case for why arts organizations should make more comprehensive digital experiences for audience engagement. One of the bases of this argument will be accessibility and the increased access that digital experiences offer, which is mission-fulfilling and serves a real purpose for the community. Secondly, I will demonstrate how the trend of digital engagement has increased in recent years, and as the public becomes more accustomed to experiencing the arts online, there will be a higher demand for digital content. 

# Story Structure: OUTLINE

* INTRODUCTION
  * Digital landscapes have fundamentally changed. Why haven’t the arts caught up?
  * A narrative of someone accessing arts and culture who otherwise may not have
* EVIDENCE AND CASE: Why digital content can boost mission
  *  Currently, most arts organizations do not focus efforts on online content, rather they might but up a digital collection or some videos about their collections, but rarely anything live and engaging.
  * Quantitative DATA: From Culture Track’s Top Line Report: Digital engagement survey responses. (Shows the GENERAL AUDIENCE VALUE In digital experiences)
