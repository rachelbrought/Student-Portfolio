# Final Part One: Planning, Sketching, Researching

## Summary of Project:
For my Telling Stories with Data final project, I would like to make a case for why arts organizations should make more comprehensive digital experiences for audience engagement. One of the bases of this argument will be accessibility and the increased access that digital experiences offer, which is mission-fulfilling and serves a real purpose for the community. Secondly, I will demonstrate how the trend of digital engagement has increased in recent years, and as the public becomes more accustomed to experiencing the arts online, there will be a higher demand for digital content. 

## Story Structure: Outline

* INTRODUCTION
  * Digital landscapes have fundamentally changed. Why haven’t the arts caught up?
  * A narrative of someone accessing arts and culture who otherwise may not have
* EVIDENCE AND CASE: Why digital content can boost mission
  *  Currently, most arts organizations do not focus efforts on online content, rather they might but up a digital collection or some videos about their collections, but rarely anything live and engaging.
  * Quantitative DATA: From Culture Track’s Top Line Report: Digital engagement survey responses. (Shows the GENERAL AUDIENCE VALUE In digital experiences)
* ACCESSIBILITY
  * Quantitative DATA: 2012 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts shows the difference between rates of attendance of able-bodied and disabled participants.
  * Qualitative DATA: From “Creating an Accessible Digital Experience: Moving from Compliance to Sustainable Accessibility and Usability”
* HOW IT CAN BE DONE
  * Show BEST PRACTICE (Via visualizations made from looking at Wayback machine) a timeline of movement into the digital realm of a singular arts org (who is doing it well) – their journey to offering more digital content. 
  * FINAL CASE: Tie the Household Pulse Survey (pull Changes in digital habits over past 5 years) into arts organizations: We can make some assumptions about digital arts engagement knowing about digital shopping engagement.
* CONCLUSION AND CALL TO ACTION
  * Re-iterate how this can serve your mission, heighten accessibility, and reach a wider audience.
  * (Considering the “users” of this message would be arts managers): Link to consulting firms, best practices articles and other tools they can use if they want to start ramping up their digital content.
