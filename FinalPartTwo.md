# Final Part Two
For this iteration of my final, I took my sketches and started building them out on Canva and Flourish using the data I found.
Something I came across was that once I was actually putting the (draft) visualizations into Shorthand I was able to see gaps in my argument more clearly. I ended finding a few new sources that would help my argument and made some visualizations based off of those.
I also took into account the initial feedback I got on my sketch was, and tried to use some more data to really show the connections and value of my argument.
I chose a color pallette, then built out my wireframes and storyboard in Shorthand.

## User Research on storyboards
The target audience that I would hope to reach with my research is fellow arts administrators. For that reason, I selected a few fellow arts management students to review my work. Additionally, because I would like this work to be accessible/understandable to anyone, I also asked some non-arts management people to review (two individuals in the PPM program from class, and my roommate.)

I asked a few arts management students to review my work under the following criteria:
- Did the visualizations add to or take away the central argument?
- Did anything confuse you?
- Do you think the story supports the call to action?
- What would you do differently?

I received a lot of helpful feedback, positive and negative, that will inform my work as I move into the final stages of the project. 
- Visualizations--Everyone said that the visualizations add to the argument.
- Confusion--Some of the consistent feedback I got was that the visualizations become a bit overwhelming. I orginially had a continuous scroll of one visualization after the other, but I changed that based on feedback so that multiple data points would be included in a single visual (The increase in digital engagement.)
- Call to action: I also received feedback that the call to action could be stronger, and that I might include a data visualization in the call to action.
- What people would do differently: Most of this feedback was surrounding visuals and formatting. Interviewees mentioned that I should directly embed my visualizations from Canva so the formatting isn't so awkward, and use more of the interactive/moving features in Shorthand.

Some key quotes from my user research:
- "I like how you keep the same color scheme and use a few different kinds of visualizations"
- "The call to action could be stronger, and include practical resources" (I added in a section that I plan on working on regarding resources.)
- "Could you make the images on the line graph more clear?"
