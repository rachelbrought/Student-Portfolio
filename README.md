## About Me
My name is Rachel Broughton and I am a second-year Master of Arts Management Student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. I am utilizing this platform to build a portfolio as I learn data visualization tools that will enhance my skills as a museum administrator.
I hope to learn how to create striking, accessible, and legible data visualizations that not only allow people to understand concepts more holistically, but also motivate action and change! This is a skill that I haven't developed yet, so I am very excited to dive in with this class.
