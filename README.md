## About Me
My name is Rachel Broughton and I am a second-year Master of Arts Management Student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. I am utilizing this platform to build a portfolio as I learn data visualization tools that will enhance my skills as a museum administrator.
## What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to create striking, accessible, and legible data visualizations that not only allow people to understand concepts more holistically, but also motivate action and change! There are many data visualization tools out there that I hope to come out of this class comfortable with using. This is a skill that I haven't developed yet, so I am very excited to dive in with this class.

This is my work:


# Assignment One
## Visualizing Government Debt
Using the OECD Dataset, I downloaded this bar chart showing Debt-to-GDP ratios:

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Ofz" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2021</iframe>
Next, I translated that dataset to visualize it in a few new ways vis Flourish:


Flourish Exercise #1
Here is the First visualization of government debt using Flourish. This grid of charts allows you to compare by country, the Debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995-2019.

Flourish Exercise #2
This second visualization created on Flourish allows you to toggle by country. This chart could be easier than the grid if someone wanted to focus on just a few countries in particular, and easily see the differences by toggling back and forth.
