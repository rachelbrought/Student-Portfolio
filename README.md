## About Me
My name is Rachel Broughton and I am a second-year Master of Arts Management Student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. I am utilizing this platform to build a portfolio as I learn data visualization tools that will enhance my skills as a museum administrator.
