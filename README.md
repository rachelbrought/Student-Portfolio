# Student Portfolio: Telling Stories with Data

## About Me
My name is Rachel Broughton and I am a second-year Master of Arts Management Student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. I am utilizing this platform to build a portfolio as I learn data visualization tools that will enhance my skills as a museum administrator.
## What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to create striking, accessible, and legible data visualizations that not only allow people to understand concepts more holistically, but also motivate action and change! There are many data visualization tools out there that I hope to come out of this class comfortable with using. This is a skill that I haven't developed yet, so I am very excited to dive in with this class.
