# Critique by Design Assignment
For this assignment, I chose to critique and re-design this chart from the Wave 1 Findings of the Culture Track Survey, "Culture and Community in a Time of Crisis" which is a large-scale survey that measured audience and public engagement with arts and culture organizations during the Covid-19 lockdown.
Here is the image: ![Play to Emotional strengths](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112904052/191043547-2dd595f4-9cc9-4655-9c48-b4207df54dda.jpeg)

This image, while conveying quite important information relevant to those in the arts and culture nonprofit sector, is not easily readable at first. The first thing I noticed while looking at this graph was an excessive amount of text and color. Next, I noticed that I wanted to immediately find "art museum" and then see what people are saying about it. I found that it took awhile for me to fully find and digest the data points relevant to art musuem.
Because this data visualization is used to educate arts managers, I figured it would be more useful if they could quickly naviagte to their specific field, and then play around with comparing it to others should they have the time. But I figured the priority should be that they find their field easily, and be able to read the relevant information. The bubbles corresponding to the small legend at the top made it a bit difficult to look back and forth and see what each colored bubble corresponded to, especially because the color scheme is the "Rainbow Method", in which the colors don't have any inherent meaning other than separating values.
