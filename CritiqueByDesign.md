# Critique by Design Assignment
For this assignment, I chose to critique and re-design this chart from the Wave 1 Findings of the Culture Track Survey, "Culture and Community in a Time of Crisis" which is a large-scale survey that measured audience and public engagement with arts and culture organizations during the Covid-19 lockdown. 
This visualization shows, based on survey respondents' preferred arts and culture experiences, what qualities they are looking for when they are able to return to in-person programming. 


Here is the image:

This chart, while conveying quite important information relevant to those in the arts and culture nonprofit sector, is not easily readable at first. The first thing I noticed while looking at this graph was an excessive amount of text and color. Next, I noticed that I wanted to immediately find "art museum" and then see what people are saying about it. I found that it took awhile for me to fully find and digest the data points relevant to art musuem.
As you can see, there are multiple variables: Preferred arts experience (Children's museum, dance performance, etc), Qualities (Beautiful, Active, fun, etc), and highest qualities chosen, percent-wise. 

Because this data visualization is used to educate arts managers, I figured it would be more useful if they could quickly naviagte to their specific field, and then play around with comparing it to others should they have the time. But I figured the priority should be that they find their field easily, and be able to read the relevant information. The bubbles corresponding to the small legend at the top made it a bit difficult to look back and forth and see what each colored bubble corresponded to, especially because the color scheme is the "Rainbow Method", in which the colors don't have any inherent meaning other than separating values.
I also thought that the Title and Survey question made the chart a bit difficult to understand from the outset, and thought it might be a bit too wordy. Additionally, the bubbles make it difficult to actually compare the percentages represented--the size of them has little orientation to anything else, and makes 57% look vastly different from 49%, for example.

Overall, although it is stylistically pleasant and has very useful information, I just thought there was a bit too mcuh going on.

## Sketching and Formulating a New Design
My first thought when creating a new design was that bar charts would be more appropriate than the bubbles. It would convey the actual data more objectively, and be easier to compare side-by-side.
I also wanted to get rid of some of the extraneous use of color by making labels, titles, and description text in black. I sketched up a grid of bar charts that included the survey question:
